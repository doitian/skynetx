# Stdlib's contributors

This file lists major contributors to _stdlib_. If you think you
should be on it, please raise a [github][] issue. Thanks also to all
those who have contributed bug fixes, suggestions and support.

Gary V. Vaughan now maintains _stdlib_, having rewritten and reorganised
the libraries for hygiene, consistent argument type checking in debug
mode, and object orientation, in addition to adding a lot of new
functionality.

Reuben Thomas started the standard libraries project, wrote many of the
libraries, and integrated code from other authors.

John Belmonte helped set the project up on lua-users, and contributed
to the early organisation of the libraries.

The call trace debugging code is based on test/trace-calls.lua from
the Lua 5.0 distribution.

Jamie Webb contributed several miscellaneous functions from his
private standard library.

Johann Hibschman supplied the code on which math.floor and math.round
were based.
